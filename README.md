Buildthat [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lsolesen/buildthat.svg?branch=7.x-1.x)](https://travis-ci.org/lsolesen/buildthat)
==

Just a couple of make files to be able to build a Drupal with the mostly used contrib modules.

    drush make https://raw.github.com/lsolesen/buildthat/7.x-1.x/buildthat.build ~/workspace/buildthat

See http://drupal.org/project/openoutreach for a clever way to not include all stuff into one make file.
